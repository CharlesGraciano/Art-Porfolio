<p style=" font-size: 300%; color: white">Iâ€™m Charles Graciano, and I am an artist in visual communication and Digital Media Graphics and a first generation Mexican American in the Bay Area. My mother also influenced my art career towards chasing my dreams. Her passion towards success and fulfillment inspired me to become an artist and create beyond my wildest imaginations. Motion graphics has always fascinated me the most when digital media is involved; whether it is developing concepts, designing precisional elements, and working with a group of great ideas. Throughout my childhood, art has always fascinated me by the craft of creativity and the capability for imagery to speak louder than words. From a very young age, I have had a sincere admiration of Disney and their distinctive animation and design technique. Walt Disney not only motivated me to pursue an art career, but reminded me how much creativity and passion go towards success. While studying in San Francisco at The Art Institute of California - San Francisco,  I learned about the involvement with media graphics and gained an experience with traditional animation and active motion picture; trained by professionals who served and are currently in the entertainment industry.</p>
