<p style=" font-size: 300%; color: white">I am an artist in visual communication and  Digital Media Graphics. Motion graphics fascinate me the most when digital media is involved. While studying in San Francisco, I learned a lot about the involvement with media graphics. I have experience with traditional animation and was trained by active motion picture professionals who served and are currently in the in the entertainment industry. I'm working towards developing my content and elaborate my concepts into productions. A lifetime goal of mine is to colaborate my concpets and skills with the Walt Disney Company and Pixar to create character development, graphic design and digital editing.  <p>
